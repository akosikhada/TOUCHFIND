## üîç Project Description

TOUCHFIND is a tool that helps people pick the right tech items with ease. It gives tips on products based on what you need, which makes shopping quicker and easier. It also has tracking sales and stock features to help shop owners run their places well.

This project stands out because it uses Product Discovery Module, cutting people's time looking for things. Unlike everyday shopping, where you depend on shop workers or guess what to buy, TOUCHFIND offers fast and correct tips. This makes it new and valuable in today's quick retail world.

## üìä Scope and Limitations

### Scope of the Study

**Objective**: Create TOUCHFIND, a Product Recommender System to enhance the shopping experience for hardware by DIY'ers, contractors, shelf locators, and regular customers.

- **Personalized Recommendations**: The system will provide recommendations on hardware products from user input, preference, and history of browsing, thus enabling customers to find tools and materials with ease.
- **POS System Integration**: TOUCHFIND will be integrated with the store's point-of-sale (POS) system to provide real-time inventory updates and enable customers to view the most current stock levels.
- **Payment Processing**: Payments will be accepted only at the retail counter, offering a safe and controlled checkout process.
- **User Interface Design**: The system will have a simple-to-use interface to enable customers to interact with the recommender system effectively.
- **Application/System Integration**: The system will be integrated into the current retail setting, with it functioning smoothly with ongoing store operations.

### Limitations of the Study

- Product suggestions cannot be determined if more effective because they rely more on product availability of the store
- Transaction modalities are constrained to over-the-counter interactions
- Receipt access is limited to kiosk interface
- Voice-based language adaptation is not implemented
- Pre-purchase physical evaluation is not supported
- Our application just presents an item list; there are no transactions
